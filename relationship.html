          </h1>
          <p class="">
            Communication is the cornerstone of healthy relationships. It
            involves expressing thoughts, feelings, and needs openly and
            honestly, while also listening with empathy and understanding.

          <p class="">
            Communication challenges are common in relationships and can include

          <h1 class="font-semibold">3. Active Listening and Empathy :</h1>
          <p class="">
            Active listening involves fully focusing on what the other person is
            saying, without interrupting or judging, and responding with empathy
            and understanding. It's about validating the other person's feelings
            and perspective.

            Assertive communication involves expressing thoughts, feelings, and
            needs in a clear, respectful, and non-confrontational manner. It's
            about advocating for yourself while also being mindful of the other
            person's feelings.

          <p class="">
            Conflict is a natural part of relationships, but how we manage and
            resolve conflicts can make all the difference. Effective conflict
            resolution involves staying calm, focusing on the issue at hand, and
            seeking win-win solutions through compromise and collaboration.

            relationships. Building trust involves being reliable, honest, and

            through shared experiences, vulnerability, and emotional intimacy.
